Efficient combat training in Oldschool Runescape is a problem of maximizing the damage output rate of the player (often measured by DPS). To optimize the DPS it is important to be able to determine its value also theoretically. Overkill and hitpoint regeneration are two major factors that have significant effects on DPS, yet the quantitative understanding of them is limited.
While simulations provide quite good results, a more mathematical viewpoint can give further insight into the nature of these effects and result in some convenient approximations.

Overkill is an effect that occurs when the damage roll exceeds the remaining hitpoints of the enemy. It is important in combat training when the idle time between kills is short, and especially when the max hit is large relative to the enemy hitpoints.

The other mechanic that will be studied is health regeneration. Assuming no regeneration is a fair approximation when regeneration rate is much slower than the damage rate. But there are inevitably scenarios where this is not the case. Whereas overkill is most significant for high damage rates, regeneration affects mostly the slower fights. While there are many ways to regain health, we will be focusing on \textit{natural regeneration} only.
