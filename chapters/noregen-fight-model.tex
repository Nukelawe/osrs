\subsection{Fight model}\label{chap:fightModel}
We define the \textit{state space} as the set of all possible values the remaining hitpoints of the enemy can have during a fight. For a fight against an enemy with $h$ maximum hitpoints the state space is $\{0,\ldots,h\}$. Each hit corresponds to a transition from one state to another in the state space. The probability of transitioning to state $i$ from state $j$ is called the \textit{transition probability} and is defined as
\begin{align}\label{eq:transitionProbabilities}
    p_{ij} = \Pr{H_k = i \mid H_{k-1} = j}.
\end{align}

Let $H_k$ be the number of hitpoints the enemy has remaining after $k$ hits. A fight can be labeled with a sequence of visited hitpoint states $(H_k)_{k=0}^{n}$. For the sequence to constitute a valid $n$-hit fight we must have $H_n=0$ (fight ends in death) and $h \geq H_k > 0$ for $k<n$ (death does not happen before the last hit). As an example consider a 4-hitpoint enemy that the attacker hits 3 times, first 1, then 0 and finally 3 damage killing the enemy. This fight would be described by the sequence $4,3,3,0$ and corresponds to the highlighted path in the state space diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:stateSpace}.
