\subsection{Fight model}\label{chap:fightDef}
We define the \textit{state space} as the set of all possible values remaining hitpoints can have during a fight. For a fight against an enemy with $h$ maximum hitpoints the state space is $\{0,\ldots,h\}$. Let $H_k$ be the number of hitpoints the enemy has remaining after $k$ hits. Fights can be labeled with a sequence of hitpoint states $(H_k)_{k=0}^{n}$ visited during the fight. For this to make sense we must have $H_n=0$ (fight ends in death) and $h \geq H_k > 0$ for $k<n$ (death does not happen before the last hit).
The probability of transitioning to state $i$ from state $j$ is called the \textit{transition probability} and is defined as
\begin{align}\label{eq:transitionProbabilities}
    p_{ij} = \Pr{H_k = i \mid H_{k-1} = j}.
\end{align}

Let $\mathcal{S}_j^n$ be the set of all possible $n$-hit fights against an enemy with $j$ hitpoints remaining. The simplest possible case are the 1-hit fights $\mathcal{S}_j^1 = \{(j,0)\}$. The sets of all longer fights can be defined recursively by noticing that if the first hit lowers the hitpoints to $i$, the remaining sequence of states is equivalent to a fight of length $n-1$ against an enemy with $i$ hitpoints remaining. In other words
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{S}_j^n &=  \{j\} \times \bigcup_{i=1}^h \mathcal{S}_i^{n-1} \quad \mbox{for } n>1.\label{eq:fightRecursion}
\end{align}
For the set of all 2-hit fights this gives $\mathcal{S}_j^2 = \{(j,h,0), (j,h-1,0), \ldots, (j,2,0), (j,1,0)\}$.
